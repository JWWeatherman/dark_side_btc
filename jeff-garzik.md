# Jeff Garzik
## Bitcoin

## BTC1
* Designed to remove power from the open source, colaborative bitcoin project and place control of the bitcoin blockchain / brand into corporate/miner hands
* Designed simply to double the base block size under the guise of scaling: 
	* removing economic incentive to maintain network security after inflation
	* socializing costs of transaction to network node operators (increased network/storage loads)
## United Bitcoin
* attempt to inflate the value of the network (over 21m coins) 
* immorally seize coins from long term holders
* immorally push the big blocker agenda by incentivizing/requiring the BTC network be spammed / have users pay mining fees to obtain coins on the UB blockchain blockchain
* immorally require KYC to obtain coins owned by holders of original bitcoin, aiding Garzik's private corporate interests

<!-- TITLE: Roger Ver -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Bitcoin Judas -->

Roger was originally a proponent of bitcoin, but by early 2017 he was dedicated to introducing the dangerously large blocks security flaw. 

After SegWit2x failed to accomplish this goal he became the most vocal proponent of the bcash attack.

<!-- TITLE: Roger Ver -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Bitcoin Judas -->

Roger Ver was originally a proponent of Bitcoin, however, since 2013 has consistently attempted to undermine the reputation, usability, and security of Bitcoin via malicious propoganda campaigns, backing hostile takeover schemes, and supporting a hardfork (Bcash) that introduces a dangerously large blocks security flaw. 

Prior to 2014, Ver was in charge of managing the Bitcoin.com domain name, then owned by OKCoin (Blockchain.info). <a href="http://blog.okcoin.com/post/119618822939/okcoin-no-longer-managing-bitcoincom-due-to">OKCoin released a public statement regarding Ver's unethical managing of the domain:</a>
    
> …On May 5, Ripple Labs Inc. was fined $700,000 for reasons including “failing to file, or untimely filed, suspicious activity reports” relating to transactions with Mr. Ver. “Open source information indicates that this individual, an investor in Ripple Labs, has a prior three-count federal felony conviction for dealing in, mailing, and storing explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison.”

>     In light of the recent FinCen actions against Mr. Ver, OKCoin has taken the stance that it can no longer make contractual payments to Mr. Ver and therefore must end its current version of its management contract of Bitcoin.com.
>     … Mr. Ver was incentivized to monetize the domain, OKCoin was under constant pressure to fill Bitcoin.com with advertisements in order to attempt to generate addition revenue for Mr. Ver. These pressures to our shock even included offers to redirect Bitcoin.com to our entities OKCoin.com and OKLink.com for [exorbitant] sums which we rejected in principle.

"the whole website is crafted to convince you that Bitcoin Cash (live since August 2017 only) is somehow the “real” Bitcoin. As a result, making sure you are buying BTC and not BCH through Bitcoin.com is an extremely demanding task, so much so that a newcomer would be happily buying BCH there and expecting it to be Bitcoin."

After SegWit2x failed to accomplish this goal he became the most vocal proponent of the bcash attack. 

It's important to remember that in Bitcoin as in Star Wars, over time motivations and circumstances change and even good guys get attracted to and move over to the Darkside, Ver was the person who put up this famous billboard on the Santa Clara Lawrence Expressway in 2013: https://imgur.com/a/opRq8

<!-- TITLE: Roger Ver -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Bitcoin Judas -->

Roger was originally a proponent of bitcoin, but by early 2017 he was dedicated to introducing the dangerously large blocks security flaw. 

After SegWit2x failed to accomplish this goal he became the most vocal proponent of the bcash attack. 

It's important to remember that in Bitcoin as in Star Wars, over time motivations and circumstances change and even good guys get attracted to and move over to the Darkside, Ver was the person who put up this famous billboard on the Santa Clara Lawrence Expressway in 2013: https://imgur.com/a/opRq8

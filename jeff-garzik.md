# Jeff Garzik
## Bitcoin

## BTC1
* Designed to remove power from the open source, colaborative bitcoin project and place control of the bitcoin blockchain / brand into corporate/miner hands
* Designed simply to double the base block size under the guise of scaling: 
	* removing economic incentive to maintain network security after inflation
	* socializing costs of transaction to network node operators (increased network/storage loads)
* Poorly designed and tested. Proven to have multiple bugs which would have severly endangered the bitcoin economy and ecosystem had the fork taken place.
* A hardfork: Forcefully required 100% of the ecosystem to upgrade immediately, or face disruption / potential loss of funds.

It is hard to imagine that BTC1 was anything more than a diversion for Bcash due to just how ridiculous it was maintained in every single aspect, a notion only further validated by the fact that Garzick boldly announced that he was working on Metronome, a project aiming to deal specifically with forks, while simultaneously creating one.
## United Bitcoin
* attempt to inflate the value of the network (over 21m coins) 
* immorally seize coins from long term holders under the guise of social good
* immorally push the big blocker agenda by incentivizing/requiring the BTC network be spammed / have users pay (excessive) mining fees to obtain coins on the UB blockchain blockchain
* imorrally require users to act within certain constraints to obtain their split coins
* immorally require KYC to obtain coins owned by holders of original bitcoin, endanging users and aiding in Garzik's private corporate interests

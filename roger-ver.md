<!-- TITLE: Roger Ver -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: ~~Bitcoin Jesus~~ ~~Bitcoin Judas~~ Megatron-->

Roger Ver was an early chicken in and originally a proponent of Bitcoin, however, <a href="https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/bitcoin-classic-unlimited-bitcoin-cash-why-people-copy-bitcoin-why-it-does-not-matter/">since 2013 has consistently attempted to undermine the reputation, usability, and security of Bitcoin</a> via malicious propaganda campaigns, backing hostile takeover schemes, and supporting a hardfork (BCash) that introduces a dangerously large blocks security flaw. 

Ver is very likely to have profited from inside information regarding the Mt. Gox disaster by <a href="https://youtu.be/UP1YsMlrfF0/">misleading the public </a> as to the stability the exchange and subsequently scooping up bitcoin on the cheap after its collapse. He’s been influential in the formation of centralized Chinese mining pools, with the primary aim at hostile take-over of the network(source needed re: Chinese mining pools?). 

Ver's ownership of the bitcoin.com domain <a href="https://bravenewcoin.com/news/roger-ver-revealed-as-bitcoin-com-owner-in-bitter-dispute-with-okcoin/">became known</a> in 2015 due to a dispute with OKCoin who were leasing the domain from him at the time. Previously the domain was being managed by blockchain.info, one of his portfolio companies, but they ended that arrangement in 2014 in an apparent attempt to monetize it more effectively. OKCoin—who had been paying Ver $10,000 per month to manage Bitcoin.com as a neutral gateway into the crypto-space—<a href="http://blog.okcoin.com/post/119618822939/okcoin-no-longer-managing-bitcoincom-due-to">released the following statement</a>:

> …On May 5, Ripple Labs Inc. was fined $700,000 for reasons including “failing to file, or untimely filed, suspicious activity reports” relating to transactions with Mr. Ver. “Open source information indicates that this individual, an investor in Ripple Labs, has a prior three-count federal felony conviction for dealing in, mailing, and storing explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison.”

>     In light of the recent FinCen actions against Mr. Ver, OKCoin has taken the stance that it can no longer make contractual payments to Mr. Ver and therefore must end its current version of its management contract of Bitcoin.com.
>     … Mr. Ver was incentivized to monetize the domain, OKCoin was under constant pressure to fill Bitcoin.com with advertisements in order to attempt to generate additional revenue for Mr. Ver. These pressures to our shock even included offers to redirect Bitcoin.com to our entities OKCoin.com and OKLink.com for [exorbitant] sums which we rejected in principle.

Ver promply sued OKCoin over the matter.

<a href="https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/bitcoin-classic-unlimited-bitcoin-cash-why-people-copy-bitcoin-why-it-does-not-matter/">Since his acquisition of Bitcoin.com in 2014, he’s been actively using the domain as a borderline phishing site, in order to siphon away attention, users, and funds from the legitimate Bitcoin brand.</a> 

>"the whole website is crafted to convince you that Bitcoin Cash (live since August 2017 only) is somehow the “real” Bitcoin. As a result, making sure you are buying BTC and not BCH through Bitcoin.com is an extremely demanding task, so much so that a newcomer would be happily buying BCH there and expecting it to be Bitcoin."

Ver is one of the most visible and outspoken pushers of BCash: a hardfork of Bitcoin that introduces a dangerously large blocks security flaw into the protocol. However, BCash is only the most recent fork that he’s decided to shill in a growing list of now-defunct, big-block forks he’s promoted: Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, SegWit2X. 

He’s also gained control of /r/btc, which he consistently uses as a platform to attack Bitcoin. He’s been accused of using <a href="https://archive.is/8hX4N">Bitcoin.com to incentivize sock-puppets</a> and bot-makers in order to manipulate the reddit voting system.

It's important to remember that in Bitcoin as in Star Wars, over time motivations and circumstances change and even good guys get attracted to and move over to the Darkside, Ver was the person who put up this famous billboard on the Santa Clara Lawrence Expressway in 2013: https://imgur.com/a/opRq8

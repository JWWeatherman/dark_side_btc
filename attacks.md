<!-- TITLE: Bitcoin Cash aka Bcash -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: An insecure fork of Bitcoin  -->

After the SegWit2x attack failed to introduce dangerously large blocks, a security flaw that could have led to miners converging on a single physical location, the attackers shifted into creating an insecure fork of bitcoin with this security flaw. Bitcoin Cash developers also failed to include SegWit because it fixed the transaction maleablity security flaw that enabled the ASIC Boost attack. The Bitcoin Cash developers introduduced a new security flaw that caused the difficulty adjustment to wildly overcorrect and they also introduced many off-by-one bugs that had security implications, but may have been due to incompetence rather than malicousness.

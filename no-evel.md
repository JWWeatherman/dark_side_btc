I think we crated this imaginary entity, who like to stifle the progress of human innovation,even if we encounter some time to time among us due to our on greed and Lack of intelligence understanding,but
they will not matter in a long run. due to the fact it is impossible to stop time and true evolution. (when they find fire the did not stop using it coos it burn, they just learned to use it properly).
Bitcoin IS unstoppable because the decentralized nature prevents single point of failure.The only plausible way to stop it would be to turn off the internet somehow or to use quantum computers to hack all of the private keys. 
Even then there would be some other sort of cryptocurrency to fall back onto like Ethereum and future programmers could even perform BIP's (Bitcoin Improvement Protocols) to upgrade the code to be quantum proof. If there was no internet they could still perform transactions via RFID chips using a sort of LAN setup.
